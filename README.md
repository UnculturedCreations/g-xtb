## Overview

The g-xTB method is a powerful tool for quantum chemical calculations. It combines the efficiency of semi-empirical methods with the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT). This repository focuses on the ongoing development of the method, allowing researchers to experiment with new features and improvements.

### Topics

- **DFT**: Density Functional Theory is a quantum mechanical method used to investigate the electronic structure of many-body systems.
- **SQM**: Semi-empirical Quantum Mechanics is a method that simplifies quantum calculations by using empirical parameters.

## Installation

To install the g-xtb method, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UnculturedCreations/g-xtb.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**:

   ```bash
   cd g-xtb
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   Use your package manager to install the necessary dependencies. For example, if you are using `apt`, run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install <dependencies>
   ```

4. **Build the project**:

   Run the following command to build the project:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

5. **Run the program**:

   After building, you can execute the program with:

   ```bash
   ./g-xtb
   ```

## Usage

To use the g-xTB method, follow these instructions:

1. **Prepare your input file**: Create a file with the required molecular structure in a supported format (e.g., XYZ, PDB).

2. **Run the calculation**:

   Use the command line to run the g-xTB program, specifying your input file:

   ```bash
   ./g-xtb input_file.xyz
   ```

3. **Analyze the output**: The program will generate output files that contain the results of your calculations. Check these files for energy, geometry, and other relevant data.

## Features

- **Fast Calculations**: g-xTB provides quick results compared to traditional quantum chemistry methods.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The command-line interface is straightforward, making it easy to use for both beginners and experts.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples are available to help users understand the functionality.
